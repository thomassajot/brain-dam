Minimize the negative business impact of the B experiement while still experimenting at a reasonable pace.

> note: it is not a good idea to just to regular AB testing with a smaller proportion of pop doing the B exp. Because in the need we need a significant amount of people doing the B exp in order to reject or not the hypothesis. so routing 99% to exp A and 1% to exp B is practically the same as doing 50/50. 


So during the 14 day trials of this AB, we measure the performance at 7 days. and how do we choose to route customers more efficiently given this partial experiemnt so far ? 

# Exploitation vs exploration
## Epsilon greed strategy
How much better is this epsilon greed vs regular AB testing. 

# Thomson sampling
The frequency a user should be allocated to an experiment should equal the probability of that experience being optimal.
