Why is it preferred over [[Frequentist AB testing]] ?
- easier to interpret results. We don't have a p-value and a confidence interval, with Bayesian we can directly answer the question: what is the proba that B is better than experiment A.
- Often fewer samples to each launch decision 
	--> which means faster exp. 
	--> which means faster improvements
