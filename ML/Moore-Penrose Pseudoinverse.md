Matrix inversion is not defined for matrices that are not square. 
To get the pseudo inverse of a matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$, we use the [[Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)|SVD]] of $\boldsymbol{A}$. Then the pseudo inverse of $\boldsymbol{A}$ is:

$$
\boldsymbol{A}^+ = \boldsymbol{V} \boldsymbol{D}^+\boldsymbol{U}^T
$$
