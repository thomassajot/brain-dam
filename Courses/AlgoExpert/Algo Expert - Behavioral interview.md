**Behavioural interviews** aim to evaluate skills that enables the worker to perform well. These are skills that come about with maturity, working experience, mistakes, successes and so on. 

This interview is mainly a one sided conversation. Most questions will be about your passed experiences. With some other questions like *"Why do you like this company"*. 

Depending on the company, the job offer and the candidate, the behavioural interview will be quite different and the bar to pass will vary greatly.

Examples:
- People skill
	- How do you motivate people you manage
	- How do you resolve conflicts
- Experienced / seasoned worker:
	- How do you handle problems in production
	- How do you deal with stress 
	- Present to failures (show you learn from mistakes)
	- Present some success (show some humility)
- Structured:
	- How do you approach new problem
	- How do you distribute tasks
- Handle working in a company with different stake holders:
	- How do you present to non-technical ppl ideas
	- How do you convince people



# General tips
**You have to prepare for Behavioural interviews.** If you think you can go without preparation, think again.

1. Never reply in a manner that is:
	- offensive, disrespectful, confrontational or arrogant.
	- **too vague**: The interviewers are looking for signals to assess your skill. So you have to be specific, how you reacted to events, what you learned from these events, what you actually contributed to.


2. Positive points you want to include:
	- Strike a balance between good qualities and ability to work with others. 
	- Try to answer question with stories that highlight the above point.

3. Do not lie.
4. Make sure to talk only about the relevant stuff. 
5. *"What happened when you had a low performer?"* But what if you never had this scenario ? Mention it to the interviewer, and say that you can say how you would react if it were to happen.
6. General comm skills. You don't need to be a great speaker, but you want to be concise, specific, use the right answer for the right question.
7. To best prepare, do mock interviews. See how you would answer and how other people answer them.


# Example questions
## Imagine you have a low performer in your team. How would you handle this ? 

You need to ask more question or give context in your answer: 
- in what way they were a low performer. Did they introduce one bug ? Multiple bugs ? In production ? 
- Is the low performance their fault or not their fault ?
- Is the code base already riddled with tech debt ? 


How to help them ? 
- Provide constructive feedback. 
- Offer help, unblock them, let them know they can ask for help.
- Take notes on ALL the steps that were taken to help the person. This is useful because it gives context, and could help the poor performer next time (as in the issue was not them so they should not be blamed for it, or they improved since then.) But also if no improvement is coming then you can escalate above.

## Team conflict: describe a time when there was a conflict within the team ? Describe how you handle it and how you mitigate them in the future ? 
#### My Story:
- Callsign: Peter writing bad, convoluted code. Was not receptive for improvements
- BP: 
	- Mono repo vs Multi repo ? 
	- BPCS ? 
	- Order of features to work on with Rusen for BPCS POC delivery ? 
	- Conflicts with John ????????????????

#### How I would resolve a theoretical conflict ? 
My learnings so far
- assume good intent. if someone strongly reacts, it is because they have good intent. 
- Is it really that important to be in conflict over such an issue ? 


# Why do you want to work at \<company name\> ? 
I want to work at Meta for 3 reasons: 

1. technologies that really interests me
2. Meta is delivery driven. So I would love to be able to work in a team that has higher velocities.
3. The bootcamp experience. Being able to check first the teams and see later which one you prefer.


# Describe a time when you strongly disagreed with a co-worker about an engineering decision. How did you go about making the final decision and what happened after ?
#### My Story: 
My learnings so far
- I would make sure we are assuming the same problems, talking about the same issues. It happened in the past that we were talking about slightly different problems so we would not understand each other.
- The more specific you get, the less ambiguity there is. Often there are no problems when you dig into the details. It is generalisation that blurs the lines and make some ideas collide.
- Present the non technical arguments. Maybe the feature is required, maybe we have some other constraints like time.

#### My Example: 
Introducing a test framework in my team. 
The research team was more relaxed about testing due to lack of production code at the time. I presented my ideas about testing framework that would enable:
- Code sharing
- Ensure reliable code base in the future.

This has proven to be a good decision. A lot of historical code has been working well for a long time.


# Imagine there is a large project, how do you do the onboarding ? 
1. Proper documentation in place. How to setup dev env, where to look for important information, ...
2. Make yourself available for any question that they may have.
3. Carefully prick their first projects / bugs to work on. Start with simple bugs (text change, colour change, ...).  Then go for a starter project (1 to 2 weeks, self contained, not impacting anybody, that has some impact for them to feel proud).  Then go for a big project that is still non blocking for the rest of the team.

# Work distribution
#### I have not yet has this kind of experience. 
Maybe a little bit with in Blue Prism with BPCS or the later joiner before I left like Petar.

1. Scope out the work. Not too deep, not too far removed. Scope API endpoints, logical pieces of functionality. Or what are the pages required for front end.
2. Balance criticality, people preferences and people carrier trajectories.
	1. Ensure that works gets done. Hard / long or difficult work is prioritised. The most senior should do these. 
	2. Balance also preferences. But doing it takes precedences over preferences.
3. Logistics. If people have to travel, or tight calendar, time zones, ... 


# Past mistakes: 
Describe a time when you made a mistake, how did you deal with the repercussion, what lessons did you learn from it ? 

#### My mistakes
1. Chargrid errors not able to resolve.
2. BPCS when a Senior leader (Colin Redbond) got stressed that the product got too far and decided to submit the research project for scrutiny by all the senior leaders. 
	1. Deal with repercussion: Answer all their questions and asks. Reduce the scope of the project (to their eyes) make many more presentation. De-armoce the feeling that the project was out of hands. Reassure poeple. 
	2. What I learn is that: 
		1. Even if you have an idea that is bold and large. Break it down into small pieces. When doing presentation, just talk about the first small target, not the whole idea. People might think too differently from your target, but agree with the first step. Also they will think you want to achieve too much in a short amount of time.
		2. Find the right people to vouch for your project. Get ppl on your side by making thme participate in the project at a high level. 

# Challenging project
In BP, the Decision Project was the most challenging one.
Involved tight coupling between the product team and research team. Myself and another colleague were making the design decisions that can cope with the requirements coming from the ML techniques that we would be using.
The project was delivered very fast, within 4 months.

# Product Outage

# Giving and receiving feed back 
- I have not had very harsh feedback. I do appreciate / like feedback because I always strive to improve. I used to react to feedback to make them clearer to me / justify why things happens that way. But peiople usually think that I am reacting because I do not agree / appreciate the feedback. So I am less reacting to feedback and take them in. I will digest them at a later time.
	- I had great feedback from Tautvydas at Callsign:  **TODO ADD SPECIFIC FEEDBACK**
	- I had great feedback from John at BP: **TODO ADD SPECIFIC FEEDBACK**
- Harshest feedback I gave 
	-  towards my previous manager's manager (Eric Tyree in BP)
	- Towards colleagues on engineering guidelines (sometimes when helping debugging code, like with Sandeep at BP)

# Strengths and Improvements
GOOD:
- Experiences with Python
	- ML
	- Engineering
	- Making sure that products are well connected together. 
	- Resolving legacy code for the sake of making the team go forward
- Soft skills
	- Removing ambiguity: Asking questions, diving deep into a project / subject
	- 

BAD:
- Work on new languages
- Improve engineering with regards to design patterns
- Learn a new language
- Improve my ability to finish properly a project. I sometime loose motivation. Lately I found that organisation and planning provides enhances 

# Comfort Zone
Describe getting out of the comfort zone:
- Presenting ML papers during our reading groups at BP. 
- Starting a project from ground up (BPCS)

Getting out of your comfort zone is a great way to improve. I would like to do it more.
