A Database is a server that handles saving and reading data from.
`Persistence`: Outage may destroy data depending if the DB is using `disk` vs `memory`.
Reading data from memory is much faster than from disk.

Different parameters for choosing a database: 
- Persistence: Disk vs Memory 
- Enforces structure on data ?
- Availability: single vs distributed
- Consistency: ACID, eventual consistency
- Read / Write speeds
