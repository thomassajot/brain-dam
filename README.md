# Brain Dam

This website contains notes following (or trying to) the [Zettelkasten principles](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/).

I will be keeping note of many kinds for my work (ML, engineering, papers, ...) and personal knowlegde (finances) as well as interview preperations and many others !


# How do I maintain these notes ? 
I used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take the notes. The vault points directly to the root of the [git repo](https://github.com/thomassajot/brain-dam) that host this website.

Obsidian natively supports math (latext) and graphs (mermaid) in Markdown. Plugins are manually added to the git repo in order to support these as well.
