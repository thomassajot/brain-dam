After selecting a file, type `^` and continue typing to search for blocks to link to.\n\nOnce you hit enter, a link to that block will be generated for you, in the format similar to `[[filename#^dcf64c]]`, where `dcf64c` is the block ID that was just generated for you.\n\nIf you're not sure which file the block is in, another method is to type `[[^^` and search for blocks in all files. This will search through all the blocks in your vault, so expect a bit of delay if your vault is large.\n\nFor example, [[#^dcf64c]] is a link to a block above.\n\n### Embed or transclude blocks\n\nSimilar to [[Embed files|files embeds]], you can simply use `!` in front of a block link to embed it.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n![[#^dcf64c]]\n\n### Manual block IDs\n\nIf you want human readable block IDs, you can manually put `^your-id` after a block. Make sure there's at least one space if you're putting the ID at end of a line.\n\nTo refer to complex blocks like tables, put the block ID on its own after the block, and make sure there is an empty line both before and after the block ID.\n\nAfter you add the block ID manually, when you refer to that block, `your-id` will be used instead of a randomly generated block ID.\n\nNote that only letters, numbers, and dashes are allowed in manual block IDs.\n\n### Interoperability\n\nPlease be aware that block reference is not part of standard Markdown, but rather Obsidian's specific flavor of Markdown. That means these links will not work outside of Obsidian.\n\nYou can still find referenced block by searching for the block ID, although that's a rather manual process.
