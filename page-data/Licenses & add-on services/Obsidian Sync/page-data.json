[[#Third party sync|More about this later]].\n\nTo start syncing, first you need to create a remote vault that stores your encrypted data.\n\nTo do that, go to Setting => Sync => Pick remote vault => Choose => Create new vault.\n\nAfter creating it, you can immediately connect to the vault by clicking on the \"Connect\" button next to it.\n\nYou can choose to either start syncing immediately after connecting, or choose folders to ignore.\n\n##### Set encryption password \n\nBy default, you need to set an encryption password for your vault.

If you wish to encrypt it from people who use your computer, you should look for a disk encryption solution.\n\n##### How long is my data kept after my subscription expires?\n\nData in your remote vaults, including version history, is kept for one month for you, after your subscription expires.\n\nAs long as you renew within one month, there should be no impact on your usage.\n\n##### Can I use Obsidian Sync as a backup solution?\n\nObsidian Sync is designed as a data synchronization service, rather than a backup service.\n\nWith version history, it does provide some backup features, however we still recommend having additional backup measures.\n\nObsidian Sync is currently in beta testing, so we strongly recommend having backups, in case of software bugs and glitches.\n\n##### Should I pick my own encryption password?\n\nPick your password if you require the highest level of security and privacy.

If you properly backup your local vault, this may not be a problem for you.\n\n##### Is the end-to-end encryption strong?\n\nWe use industry-standard AES-256 to encrypt your data. AES-256 is a military-grade encryption specification that is widely used in online banking.\n\nHere are the technical details for those interested:\n\n- Key derivation function used: scrypt with salt\n- Encryption algorithm used: AES-256 using GCM\n\n##### What does the `vault limit exceeded` error mean?\n\nEach vault using Obsidian Sync has a maximum size of 4gb. This error indicates your vault has exceeded that limit in size. Don't forget: attachments and version history contributes to the maximum, so you may exceed your 4gb limit even if your vault's actual size is less than 4gb. \n\nIf you see this error, Obsidian can help you identify and purge large files from the Vault.
