Balance criticality, people preferences and people carrier trajectories.\n\t1. Ensure that works gets done. Hard / long or difficult work is prioritised. The most senior should do these. \n\t2. Balance also preferences. But doing it takes precedences over preferences.\n3. Logistics. If people have to travel, or tight calendar, time zones, ... \n\n\n# Past mistakes: \nDescribe a time when you made a mistake, how did you deal with the repercussion, what lessons did you learn from it ? \n\n#### My mistakes\n1. Chargrid errors not able to resolve.\n2. BPCS when a Senior leader (Colin Redbond) got stressed that the product got too far and decided to submit the research project for scrutiny by all the senior leaders. \n\t1. Deal with repercussion: Answer all their questions and asks. Reduce the scope of the project (to their eyes) make many more presentation. De-armoce the feeling that the project was out of hands. Reassure poeple. \n\t2. What I learn is that: \n\t\t1. Even if you have an idea that is bold and large. Break it down into small pieces. When doing presentation, just talk about the first small target, not the whole idea. People might think too differently from your target, but agree with the first step. Also they will think you want to achieve too much in a short amount of time.\n\t\t2. Find the right people to vouch for your project. Get ppl on your side by making thme participate in the project at a high level. \n\n# Challenging project\nIn BP, the Decision Project was the most challenging one.\nInvolved tight coupling between the product team and research team. Myself and another colleague were making the design decisions that can cope with the requirements coming from the ML techniques that we would be using.\nThe project was delivered very fast, within 4 months.\n\n# Product Outage\n\n# Giving and receiving feed back \n- I have not had very harsh feedback. I do appreciate / like feedback because I always strive to improve. I used to react to feedback to make them clearer to me / justify why things happens that way. But peiople usually think that I am reacting because I do not agree / appreciate the feedback. So I am less reacting to feedback and take them in. I will digest them at a later time.\n\t- I had great feedback from Tautvydas at Callsign:  **TODO ADD SPECIFIC FEEDBACK**\n\t- I had great feedback from John at BP: **TODO ADD SPECIFIC FEEDBACK**\n- Harshest feedback I gave \n\t-  towards my previous manager's manager (Eric Tyree in BP)\n\t- Towards colleagues on engineering guidelines (sometimes when helping debugging code, like with Sandeep at BP)\n\n# Strengths and Improvements\nGOOD:\n- Experiences with Python\n\t- ML\n\t- Engineering\n\t- Making sure that products are well connected together. \n\t- Resolving legacy code for the sake of making the team go forward\n- Soft skills\n\t- Removing ambiguity: Asking questions, diving deep into a project / subject\n\t- \n\nBAD:\n- Work on new languages\n- Improve engineering with regards to design patterns\n- Learn a new language\n- Improve my ability to finish properly a project. I sometime loose motivation. Lately I found that organisation and planning provides enhances \n\n# Comfort Zone\nDescribe getting out of the comfort zone:\n- Presenting ML papers during our reading groups at BP. \n- Starting a project from ground up (BPCS)\n\nGetting out of your comfort zone is a great way to improve. I would like to do it more.\n\n# Reference\nThis notes were taken from: AlgoExpert Behavioural questions preparation videos.","excerpt":"Behavioural interviews  aim to evaluate skills that enables the worker to perform well.
