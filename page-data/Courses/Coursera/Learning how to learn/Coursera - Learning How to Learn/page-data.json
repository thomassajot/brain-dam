It is not easy to add new memories there.\n\nTo build knowledge is to create `stable` pathways in our minds. Moving thought processes and memories from short term to long term srtorage. \n\n\n### Learning habits\nTo learn something properly, we need to:\n1. work hard on it. Making the effort to experience new pathways. Being passive is way less productive than active in the learning process (for example watchiung a video <<<< doing the implementation yourself). \n2. Then relax, sleep, meditate, cook, do something else. This freeze the attention and allows your brain to assimilate the information. During this step the brain will digesty the information and build new neurological pathways. Sleeping is very important to build this pathways.\n3. Repeat 1. and 2. ! This process helps to migrate the memory from working to long term storage.\n\n### The Pomodoro technique\nIf you are having a hard time starting a new study, because it is hard, especially if you procrastinate, the pomodoro techniques helps you: \n1. Use a timer, give yourself 25 min (you can adapt) of study the material\n2. Take a break. This gives you a (small) reward after the effort. Which motivates you further and reduces the pain / angst again this study\n\n## Take away\n- Efficient learning involves going back and forth between Focused and Diffused modes.\n- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning \n- Learning something difficult takes time. Acknowledge it ! \n- Practice makes knowledge permanent\n- You have to add rest in between focus events (use pomodoro if need be)\n- Using `Spaced repetition` is very good to migrate information from Working to Long term memory. The Anki app is one tool do follow Spaced repetition.\n- Sleeping is very important to learn:\n\t- Clean brains \n\t- Is healthy \n\t- Clears unused pathways and strengthen the others ! \n\nStudying something just before going to bed is also powerful. Your brain will work harder on it over night.\n\n__________________\n__________________\n\n\n# Week 2\n\n## Chunking\nA chunk is a compact packages of information that your mind can easily access.  \nChunking is a logical package of pieces of information to make them easier to work with this concept.\n\nThe human can sustain 4 chunks in his working memory.\nA chunk is a network of neurones that are used to firing together.  \n\n### How to form a chunk ? \n1. You need to be in focus mode. no TV or anything else. Chunking relies on building new patterns using already existing one. This does not happen well if we are not focused.\n2. You need to understand the concept you are looking to chunk. This can be done by alternating btw Focused and Diffused mode. \n\t**But understanding how a problem is solved does not mean you create a chunk**. You need to **do it**, and make sure you can use this knowledge.\n3. It is important to build **context**. which is about surrounding information connecting them to the chunk. For example doing problems related to the original chunk. This will create new neural connections to the chunk you are building which makes it easier to come back to in different situations.\n\nLearning is a 2 step process.. Chunking is a `bottom-up` way to build a chunk (one by one, to learn a specific thing). Practice will increase the number of chunks related to each other. Using the big-picture (diffused mode) you will be able to connect chunks together. This builds the **Context** that relate chunks into one another.\n![[Pasted image 20220124212910.png|600]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20220124212611.png|500]]\n\n\n## Illusions of competence in Learning\n### Importance of Recall\nIt is better to recall the information of a text just read rather than re-reading the material. The learning is faster and much deeper.\n**The retrieval process itself is useful for remembering.**\n\n### Illusion of competence\nReading the solution of a solution, and thinking `I understand what they did here`. This is not knowing and you will not improve.\n\nIn the same way, reading google solutions will keep the illusion of competence.\n\nre-reading and highlirting too much text promotes ILLUSION OF Competence. \n\n--> **Testing yourself promotes long term learning via stabilising activations patterns in a large brain area.**\n--> Do Mini testing !!!!!!!!\n--> You can train to recall your information in different rooms in order to dissociate the knowledge from where you learned it.\n\n### Value of making mistakes\nMistakes are useful during mini testing. These mistakes help correct your thinking.\n\n\n\n## Seeing the bigger Picture\n### Library of chunks\n\nHaving many chunks helps to have a library of knowledge. You need to practice with growing chunks in order to remember and srtill be able to recall / use them.\n\n### Two ways to solve problem:\n1. Sequential thinking, using the focused mode\n2. or Holistic (global) approahc. Using intuition / Diffuse modes. A solutuon the diffuse mode provide should be verified in a focused mode.\n\n\n## Interleaving\n- **Overlearning** is when you work too much on the same material within the **same session** . It is still usefull to master something, but be careful when to use it.\n- Doing also the same thing you already know in further sessions is not good and give an illusion of competence again. \n- We need to do a **Deliberate practice** which is about balancing your study, studying what you find difficult.\n- Einstellung: an idea you already have in mind prevent a better idea or solution of being found.  You need to make sure that your original intuition is not false.\n- **Interleaving**: Once you have learned a new material / chunk and are not very familiar with it, interleaving is about balancing practicing with problems of different types around this chunk.\n\nInterleave is very important. it helps to build this creative pattern that you can rely on in new problems.\n\n\n\n## Summary\n- Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through use and through meaning.\n- Chunk is a single easy item to access that uses one slot in the working memory. \n- Chunks are build with Focused attention, understanding and practice\n- Simple Recall (remembering the key points without looking at the page) is a powerful way to build chunks. \n\t- Bonus to recalling memory in different locations.\n- `Transfer` is the fact that you can relate chunks over different domains. They will help you learn new chunks\n- Interleaving learning by practicing your choice of concepts and techniques. This helps at becoming flexible with which chunks to use\n- Test yourself !!! this is a good way of avoiding the illusions of competence.\n- Mistakes are good.\n- Avoid practicing at easy stuff.\n- Einstellung is when an idea you already have in mind prevents a better idea / solutions from being found.\n- L:aw of Serendipity: just learn one thing, and you will see that the next one will be a little bit simpler to learn.\n\n\n### Notes on interview with Norman Fortenberry  @ MIT \n\n- making sure to have the \n\n__________\n__________\n# Week 3\n\n## Tackling Procrastination\nRemember the pomodoro technique (25 min work / few minutes relaxing)\n\n>**Important** Willpower is very expensive for the brain, so you should avoid using willpower against procrastination unless very necessary. There are other approaches that do not involve willpower.\n\nProcrastination is a habit. So improving procrastination will help in many domains. \n\nWhen you procrastinate, you feel better--but only temporarily.  In this, procrastination shares common features with addiction.\n\nIt is possible to control this habit, which are not intuitive to find. \n\n\n### Habits\n**Habits** is a \"zombie\" mode, it saves energy. It can be good or bad.\n\nHabits have 4 parts: \n1. The cue: triggers the routine\n2. The routine: is the zombie mode. The routine that your brain is used to go into when getting the cue.\n3. The reward: a habit gets reward. For example procrastination gives a nice reward. Good habits can be rewarding. This is a good way to escape procrastination by giving good reward on good habits\n4. The belief: habits have power because of your belief in them. For example belief that you cannot study so you have a habbit of procrastination.\n\n\n### Tricks for learning\nIt is fine to experience some bad feeling before learning something. But the important thing is to manage those feeling.\nFor example `get on with it.`. \n\nThere is another helpful way to reframe the work: Process vs Product: \n- **Process**: is the flow of time and the process associated with the flow of time: I am going to work for 25 min.\n- **Product**: My goal is to finish this assignment.\n\n**The idea is to NOT focus on product but process.** Your attention should be devoted to build habits with good processes. \nWho cares if you learned the material in one session ? The goal is to get there.\n\nThe easiest way to focus on process is to focus on the Pomodoro technique for example. \nHaving the process has a \"goal\", you don't judge yourself.\n\nThe hard part is to avoid distraction, learn to ignore them and put yourself in a position of focus (earplugs, isolated, ...)\n\n**Processes** related to simple habits. Habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done. \"just work 25 min\".\n\n### How to harness your habits to avoid procrastination and minimize use willpower\nThe trick to overwritting a habbit is to look to change a reaction to a cue. The only willpower you nmeed is to change the response to a cue.\n\n1. **The cue**: recognise what launches you into procrastination. \n\tTriggers are usually: location, time how you feel, reactions (txt msg, ...). You cna shut down your cellphone or isolated yourself.\n2. **The routine**:  The brain reacts to this cue and wants to go into the routine. \n\tThe key to change this is to have a **plan** to help cope. For example isolate yourself. The pomodoro technique is good to shift your reaction.\n3. **reward**: why are you procrastinating ? Add a new reward for your work. **It helps to add a new reward if you want to create a new habit**\n4. **The belief**: Belief in your new system works ! Having a new community can help as well. A culture with like minded ppl will help to remember the values that you should believe i (like I can learn this topic.)\n\n### Planner journal: Juggling life and learning.\nOnce  a  week write a list of key tasks. And every day write a daily task list (the evening before). \nWriting it the evening before will help you to solve these during your sleep !\n\nIf you don't write them down, these tasks list will use working memory.\n\n**Tasks can be process oriented !** Items can also be product oriented, but because they are achievable. \nThere is a goal as well. For example stop working at 5pm.\n \n mixing other tasks with your learning is helpful. These can beused as relaxation times.\n\n The more you do the tasks the more you get used to how many times can be achieve.\n\n **Planning your quitting time is very important**. \n\n Try to work on a most important and most disliked task first. Like pomodoro when you wake up.\n\n Planning well is part of trying. The law of serendipityL: lady luck favors the one who tries.\n\n ### Summary\n - keep a planner journal \n - commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day \n - get rewards after your effort \n - delay rewards until you finish a task\n - watch for procrastination cues\n - Gain trust in your new system. You want to work hard when it is time to work. And relax without bad feelings when it is time to relaex.\n- Eat your frog first. Do the harder tasks in the morning.\n\n\n## Memory\nYou can use a use another modality (usually visual) to remember a concept. For example: the formula $f = ma$, force equal mass times acceleration. could be `a flying mule arse` (FMA)\n\nThe image needs to be memorable.\n\nIndex card, spaced repetition can be helpful.\n\n\nUsing handwritting help to better learn these information.\n\nAgain interleaving the learning: ie remembering different concept is good. \nTraining for a few days is important. Increase spacing between each remembering effort.\nANKI is a great tool for this.\n\n\n### Long term memory\n\n\nWhenever you recall memory, you will remember them better. this is called `reconsolidation`. Reconsolidation also happens over sleep. \n![[Pasted image 20220213124253.png|400]]\n\nThis is why it is better to take time to learn something , rather than cram.\n\n\n## Creating meaningful groups and the memory palace technique\n\nMemory palace technique is good to remember a list of unrelated things.\n\n\n# Week 4\n## Tips for becoming a learner\n1. Exercises often ! Exercises helps new acquired neurones to stay and not decay ! \n2. Practice makes perfect, at certain times. (Not sure what was the point)\n\t1. Critical period for learning langugaes is up to purberty\n\n## Renaissance learning\n\nLearning is not just adding knowledge all the time. Sometimes it feels like the brain \"unlearned / forgot\" the previous stuff. They don't make sense anymore. This can happen because the brain is **restructuring** the knowledge ! So this is good. A step backward in the understanding is normal. When you emerge from these temporary frustration, you will notice that you know much more.\n\nPersonal experience with learning Naive Bayes classifier. It took me a few sessions of a few days each to understand it. Everytime, at the beginning of a new sessions, it seamed that everything was blurry.\n\n## Visual metaphor or analogy\nBest way to remember a memory is to use a metaphor or analogy. Even better if it is visual because we have a very good visual memory.\n\nMetaphors are very good to get free from [[Einstellung]] ! (being stuck on a problem). \n\n\n## Repetition is key\nYou need to repeat something. And you need to make sense out of the knowledge in order to acquire it.\n\nAt some point, trying to  understanding \"why\" you do what you do is counter producting. You need to accept higher level concept when you arer confortable with them.\n\nExample is einstellung. If you are using all your chuncks to keep track of all the explanations of something in your mind prevents from having space for new ideas at higher level concepts.\n\n\n**Imposter syndrome** is very common. It is normal to feel that way.\n\n\n## The value of team work\n...\n\n## Test tips:  Test checklist\nTesting yourself is a very powerful learning effort. This is **FUNDAMENTAL**. \nTesting is one of the procedure of learning.\n\nHere is a checklist for test taking: \n- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? \n\tJust hunting for relevant worked-out examples doesn't count. \n\n- Did you work with classmates on homework problems or at least check your solutions with others? \n- Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before working with classmates? \n- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions, contributing ideas and asking questions? \n- Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you were having trouble with something? \n- Did you understand all your homework problem solutions when they were handed in? \n- Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that weren't clear to you? \n- If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you could do everything on it? \n- Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time on the algebra and calculations? \n- Did you go for the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one another? \n- If there was a review session before the test, did you attended and asked questions about anything you weren't sure about? \n- Lastly, did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test?\n\n\n## Test tips: Hard start - Jump to easy\nIn a test: start on a hard problem, work on it a little / until you get stuck  (it can be just a few minutes !). Then jump to easy problems and come back to the hard one. \n\n\n ","excerpt":"Week 1 2 States of the mind: Focused and Diffused.
